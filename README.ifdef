Ifdef Patch
===========

    Conditional config options

Patch
-----

    To check if Mutt supports "ifdef", look for "patch-ifdef" in the mutt
    version.

    Dependencies
    * mutt-1.6.1

Introduction
------------

    The "ifdef" patch introduces three new commands to Mutt and allow you to
    share one config file between versions of Mutt that may have different
    features compiled in.

        ifdef  symbol config-command [args...]  # If a symbol is defined
        ifndef symbol config-command [args...]  # If a symbol is not defined
        finish                                  # Finish reading the current file

    Here a symbol can be a $variable, <function>, command or compile-time
    symbol, such as "USE_IMAP".

    'finish' is particularly useful when combined with 'ifndef'. e.g.

        # Sidebar config file
        ifndef USE_SIDEBAR finish

Commands
--------

        ifdef  symbol "config-command [args]"
        ifndef symbol "config-command [args]"
        finish
